RAL Textboard API for Golang
============================

This Golang library exposes the API of the [RAL textboard
software](https://github.com/yumi-xx/RAL).

Executive Summary
-----------------

RAL is a textboard software; the mothership instance is running at
[RalEE.org](https://ralee.org/). Here, anyone can post an idea to the
textboard and other users can reply and contribute to the *continuity of
ideas*.

The RAL software exposes a web API at `/api`
([documentation](https://github.com/yumi-xx/RAL/blob/develop/docs/API.md))
which this library uses to fetch posts and information from any site running
RAL.
